# instagram-volume-mixer

Instagram doesn't have create this feature yet... So I made it.
This is a Chrome-based extension, and to use it, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/Conexao1/instagram-volume-mixer.git
    ```

2. Open **Chrome** (or a Chrome-based browser) and go to the **Extensions** page:
    - **chrome://extensions/** (Chrome example)

3. Enable **Developer Mode**.

4. Click **Load Unpacked**.

5. Select the folder where the repository was cloned.
    
Now, just open Instagram and enjoy the volume control!
